          <b>Persona</b> was conceived in 2018, thanks to the support of the

        <h3>Our Ethos</h3>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          We are interested in the fissures and crossovers between different
          disciplines particularly art, architecture, and design.
          <b> Persona </b>
          sees itself as a producer of art and culture, not just a frozen frame
          for it, therefore making both its <b>physical space</b> and{' '}
          <b>digital portals</b>, outlets for creative expression and content
          generation.
